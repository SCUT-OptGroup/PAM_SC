# PAM_SC
This code provides a PAM method with subspace correction to solve low-rank matrix optimization problems

Please run the following steps in the Matlab command window:

1.  Run Matlab in the directory  1bit-test

2. a) To generate Figure 1 in the paper, perform:

      >> test_1bit_Lip;

   b) To generate Figure 2-3 in the paper, perform:

      >> test_1bit_Irate ;

   c) To generate Figure 4-5 in the paper, perform:

      >> test_1bit_lambda;

  d) To generate Table 2 in the paper, perform:

      >> test_1bit  with  different dimensions and c_lambda.

 Note: The numerical results obtained on different computers may be slightly different.
